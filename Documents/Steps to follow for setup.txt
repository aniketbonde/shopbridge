Kindly follow below steps after checkout from GitHub.

1.	Make sure Nodejs and Java 8 is installed on system.
2.	I have made folder as frontend and backend for clarity. So, open the workspace ex. Frontend in visual studio and import as maven project in eclipse/sts.
Front End
Run npm install in front-end project.
And ng serve â€“o
Back End 
Update maven dependency and run as spring boot application.
